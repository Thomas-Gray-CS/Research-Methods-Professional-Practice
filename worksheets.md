# Charts and Statistical Worksheets


### Worksheet 1

Within this worksheet, I have analysed data regarding two weight loss cohorts and identified the sample size, mean and standard deviation. From looking at this data, it can be seen that Diet A is more efficient, with the mean for this being higher which results in better weight loss across the group. Both groups also appear to have a similar standard deviation, indicating that the data in useful and little outliers that may weight each group are found.

### Worksheet 2

Following on from the work within worksheet 1, further analysis was completed on this weight loss data. The median value has been obtained for each sample, with these correlating closely to the applicable mean averages. This indicates that the sample size and width of values has produced a good statistical result, as if these were wildly different it would indicate a number of outliers on either side of the value. This is also reflected in the Q1, Q3 and IQR values for each sample, with these being distributed in an even way across the entire sample sizes. This would indicate that the data for each of the cohorts is valid and can be used to evidence any claims that are based on it.

### Worksheet 3

Within this worksheet, I have generated charts that highlight whether a particular brand is preferred in a certain area. Both the frequencies and percentages for each have been provided. Analysis the results, it is clear that the correlation between area 1 and area 2 is strong, with the frequencies and percentages reflecting the same kinds of sentiments. People overwhelmingly preferred a brand other than brand A or B, but in terms of just those two brands, B has a slight edge. This isn't to say, however, that this would remain if the "other" option was removed, as we cannot predict how those people would respond.

### Worksheet 4

Within this worksheet, I have generated charts that show how abundant a particular species is within two distinct areas. Upon analysing the results, it is clear that while Location A is trending upwards towards a more abundant population, Location B is performing in a completely different way, with it trending towards the population being absent. There is little that can be drawn from this, as these numbers do not provide information as to why this is happening, however if a research were to look at them they might have a slightly more clear picture of what to investigate.

### Worksheet 5

Within this worksheet, I have generated histograms that compare the effectiveness of two different weight loss products. Upon analysing the results of this, it can be inferred that both products provide similar results, however product A does seem to have a higher mean average weight loss. The curvature of product A also seems to be more consistent, indicating that there could be potential statistical outliers within product B that may need further investigation. This can be seen in the lack of any result within the bounds of -4 and -2.
