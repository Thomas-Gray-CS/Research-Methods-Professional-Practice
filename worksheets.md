### Worksheet 4

Within this worksheet, I have generated charts that highlight whether a particular brand is preferred in a certain area. Both the frequencies and percentages for each have been provided. Analysis the results, it is clear that the correlation between area 1 and area 2 is strong, with the frequencies and percentages reflecting the same kinds of sentiments. People overwhelmingly preferred a brand other than brand A or B, but in terms of just those two brands, B has a slight edge. This isn't to say, however, that this would remain if the "other" option was removed, as we cannot predict how those people would respond.

### Worksheet 5

Within this worksheet, I have generated charts that show how abundant a particular species is within two distinct areas. Upon analysing the results, it is clear that while Location A is trending upwards towards a more abundant population, Location B is performing in a completely different way, with it trending towards the population being absent. There is little that can be drawn from this, as these numbers do not provide information as to why this is happening, however if a research were to look at them they might have a slightly more clear picture of what to investigate.

### Worksheet 6

Within this worksheet, I have generated histograms that compare the effectiveness of two different weight loss products. Upon analysing the results of this, it can be inferred that both products provide similar results, however product A does seem to have a higher mean average weight loss. The curvature of product A also seems to be more consistent, indicating that there could be potential statistical outliers within product B that may need further investigation. This can be seen in the lack of any result within the bounds of -4 and -2.
